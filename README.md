# ðŸ“Š Causal ATE Estimation API (Repository: causal-ate-api-xm)

This project implements a Flask-based API that estimates and predicts the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** using a linear regression model. It accepts input data, trains a model, and provides a prediction endpoint for stakeholder engagement based on sustainability spending and treatment participation.

## ðŸ§  Model

```
Yáµ‰ = Î± + Ï„Â·Wáµ‰ + Î²Â·Xáµ‰ + Îµáµ‰
```

Where:
- **Yáµ‰**: Engagement Score (observed outcome)
- **Wáµ‰**: Treatment indicator (1 = participated, 0 = did not)
- **Xáµ‰**: Sustainability Spending ($1,000s)
- **Î±, Ï„, Î²**: Parameters to be estimated
- **Ï„**: Interpreted as the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**

## ðŸš€ Quickstart with Docker

```bash
docker build -t causal-ate-api-xm .
docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd):/app causal-ate-api-xm
```

## ðŸ“¬ API Endpoints

### `/estimate_ate` [POST]
Train the model using JSON input data:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/estimate_ate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @data.json
```

### `/predict_engagement` [GET]
Use the trained model to predict engagement:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/predict_engagement?W=1&X=20"
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "W": 1.0,
  "X": 20.0,
  "predicted_engagement_Y": 117.07
}
```

## ðŸ¦œ Component Explanations

This project is composed of modular components that together deliver a robust and reproducible machine learning API:

- **`app.py`** implements the Flask web API. It provides two main routes: `/estimate_ate` trains a linear regression model using input JSON data, and `/predict_engagement` loads the trained model to predict engagement scores based on user inputs.
- **`requirements.txt`** defines the Python package dependencies required to run the app, ensuring consistent environments across development and deployment.
- **`Dockerfile`** containerizes the application, bundling the source code, dependencies, and runtime into a single image that can be reliably run anywhere.
- **Containerization** improves reproducibility by eliminating differences in environments â€” the app runs identically across all systems that support Docker.

- **`app.py`**: Hosts the Flask API with `/estimate_ate` for model training and `/predict_engagement` for real-time predictions.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists required Python libraries including `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `joblib`, `scipy`, and `flask`.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Builds a consistent container environment for training and inference.
- **Containerization**: Ensures reproducibility and compatibility across systems without local setup.
