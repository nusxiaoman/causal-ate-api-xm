Question 1:

### b) Estimated ATE (τ̂) and Statistical Significance
The API computes the standard error and p-value of τ̂ using residual variance and the inverse of the design matrix. 
These values are returned in the JSON response and logged to `output.txt`. 
For example, τ̂ = -9.11 with p ≈ 0.00036, indicating a statistically significant treatment effect.

### c) Assumptions for Causal Interpretation of τ̂
For τ̂ to be interpreted causally, the Rubin Causal Model requires:
1. **Unconfoundedness**: Treatment is independent of potential outcomes, given observed covariates (e.g., sustainability spending).
2. **Overlap (Positivity)**: Each unit has a nonzero probability of receiving either treatment.
3. **SUTVA**: No interference between units and a single version of the treatment.

Question 2:

This application consists of modular, reproducible components:

- **`app.py`** defines a Flask API with endpoints to train a linear regression model (`/estimate_ate`) and make predictions (`/predict_engagement`). 
               It computes and returns model parameters and the statistical significance of ATE.
- **`requirements.txt`** specifies all required Python packages, ensuring consistent environment setup.
- **`Dockerfile`** containerizes the entire application to run consistently across machines.
- **Containerization** improves reproducibility by isolating the environment from local dependencies, allowing seamless execution on any Docker-enabled platform.
